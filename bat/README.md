### How to alias as `cat`

Update your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.profile`

```bash
alias cat="bat --style=plain"
```

### How to change the default behavior

Take a look at the config options:

```bash
bat --help
```

Check to see where your config file is:

```bash
echo 'N' | bat --generate-config-file
```

Edit the config file:

`~/.config/bat/config`:

```txt
# no numbers or headers, just highlighting and such
--style="plain"
```

For situations in which you must use `cat` exactly, remember that you can escape the alias:

```bash
\cat foo
```
